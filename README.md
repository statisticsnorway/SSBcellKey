# SSBcellKey
R-package to protect frequency tables by the cell-key method


This package (ver: 0.0.2)  is a delivery in a project supported by Eurostat, GRANT AGREEMENT NO: 101033953 - 2020-NO-CENSUS-GEO. In this project the cell key method and the method in the 
[SmallCountRounding](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SmallCountRounding) 
package was compared.  The SSBcellKey package was made to have an interface similar to SmallCountRounding. Thus, the methods could be easily compared.
